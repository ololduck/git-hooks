= Hooks

== Using hooks

At the root of your repository, create a `.hooks.yml` file.
You can find the one for this repository link:.hooks.yml[here].
It has two main sections: `repos` and `hooks`.

`repos` defines which valid git URL to contact to get hook definitions.
`hooks` lets you choose which hooks to use.

..hooks.yml
[source,yaml]
----
repos:
  - url: https://github.com/paulollivier/rust-hooks

hooks:
  - name: cargofmt
  - name: cargocheck

== Writing hooks

This requires 2 things: a git repository, and a file inside it named `hooks.yml`.
Not to be confused with `.hooks.yml`, which is for client configuration...

=== The hooks.yml file

.hooks.yml
[source,yaml]
----

# begins by the root element, `hooks`
hooks:
  - name: rustfmt # a name

    on_event: # an event list to react to. defaults to pre-commit, if absent
      - pre-commit
    on_file_regex: # a list of file regexps. defaults to .*
      - .*\.rs
    action: "rustfmt {files}" # the action (cli) to perform.
    setup_script: rustfmt_setup.sh # an optional setup script
