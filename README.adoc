= Git Hook Manager
Paul Ollivier <contact@paulollivier.fr>

This project is an attempt to provide a way to share easily https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks[git hooks].

In many teams, we rely on a full suite of tooling, and the need to share code conventions and quality standards.

This tool tries to unify git hook management via the well-known shared repository dotfiles mechanisms.

This tool is still in its prototyping phase, and will most likely hurt children, attempt to summon inter-plane beings and damage your git repository

== Design doc

I am convinced Rust is the language to go regarding system tooling, for its performance and error handling design.

The solution has 3 parts:

- The config file inside a repository, specifying which hook to enable for everyone, as well as hook sources.
- Multiple hook repositories containing code to set up and use a variety of tools.
For instance, a `rust` repository may contain the definitions of a `rustfmt`, `cargo check`, or even `cargo test` hook.
- The binary provided by the code alongside the document you are reading right now.
This binary needs to handle reading the repos' config file, downloading the hook repositories, and apply them on the proper git events (`pre-commit`, `post-commit`, `pre-index`, â€¦)

=== The `.hooks.yml` file

This file is expected to be found at the root of the git repository.
It contains definitions to be read by the main binary.

.Example file for a rust project
[source,yaml]
----
repos:
  - https://github.com/paulollivier/rust-hooks
hooks:
  - name: cargofmt
----

=== A hook definitions repository

This is a simple git repository, with a `hooks.yml` at its root.

[WARN]
====
Not to be confused by the `.hooks.yml`!
The dotted version is to use the git hook manager for the current repo, the non-dotted version is for hooks definitions!

.Sample file containing hook definition

      - pre-commit
    on_file_regex:
      - "*.rs"
    action: "rustfmt {files}"
    setup_script: rustfmt_setup.sh

==== Roles

* manage hook repos:
** [x] clone hooks repos
** [x] pull repos
** [ ] checkout a specific hook repo revision
* [x] init the hook repos (execute their setup script)
* [ ] `.hooks.yml` hooks section overrides `hooks.yml` definition if set
* [x] set itself up as to be executed on git events
** [x] (partial impl.) handle multiple args arguments, such as `{file}`, `{files}`, `{root}`, `{changed_files}`
** [x] restrict execution to specified file regexps
** [ ] run only when the git index contains the specified file regexps
* [ ] implement self-update
